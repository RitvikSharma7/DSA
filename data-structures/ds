A data structure helps organize and store data in a computer efficiently. We can represent a data type in many ways, but our goal is to find the best one.
We must take into consideration the efficiency when we implement a data structure.
Examples of some data structures:
  - Array
  - Stack
  - Queue
  - Linked List
  - Tree
We can use standard data structures to implement abstract data types.
An Abstract Data Type (ADT) is a mathematical model for data types, where the behavior is defined by a set of operations and their associated properties, without specifying the underlying implementation details. It focuses on what a data type does rather than how it does it.
For example, a list ADT can be implemented by using a linked list or array. The implementation depends on the circumstances.
