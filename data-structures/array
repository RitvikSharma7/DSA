An array is a collection of items of the same type that are stored in sequential fashion. It is one of the most important data structures used while manipulating data.
Element: A item stored in a array
We access each element by using index. The index starts from 0 (start of array) and ends at (length of array - 1).
The declaration/initialization of arrays depend upon the programming language used.
Properties of arrays:
  - Fixed Size Array: the size of the array is fixed, we cannot resize it if the array becomes full.
  - Dynamic Size Array: The size of the array shrinks and grows depending on the needs of the programmer. These can be implemented by using linked lists, heaps, etc.
Arrays can be of n dimension, which means they can be linear, 2-D,....
A linear array is one dimension (a row of elements), while multi-dimensional arrays more than 1 dimension.
E.G. 2-D arrays (rows and columns)
     3-D arrays (array of 2-D arrays)
